# gRPC Prime Number Client-Server Implementation

This repository contains a sample implementation of a gRPC client-server application for prime number validation. The application consists of a gRPC server that accepts prime number validation requests and a gRPC client that sends random number requests and displays responses along with round-trip times (RTT).

## Introduction

This application demonstrates how to implement a gRPC-based client-server system to validate prime numbers. The client sends random number requests to the server, which responds with whether the number is prime or not. The application showcases gRPC communication, error handling, statistics tracking, and more. Further features are listed below.

- Prime number validation using gRPC communication
- Display of responses and round-trip times on the client side
- Handling of missing responses
- Display of top 10 highest validated prime numbers on the server side
- Display the total number of messages received on the server side
